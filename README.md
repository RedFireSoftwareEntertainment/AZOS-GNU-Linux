## **The AZOS GNU/Linux operating system, general purpose, based on Arch Linux.**

AZOS is a GNU/Linux distribution, focused on providing a user friendly and secure environment and a great and fast workflow, achieved through the usage of the KDE Plasma Desktop. Our biggest goal is to make Linux an ideal platform for everyday users.

Originally based on Ezarcher, although we have really differentiated our iso from the original one. Consider supporting [eznix](https://www.youtube.com/@eznix) if you like AZOS GNU/Linux, as his ezarcher iso's laid the foundation of AZOS GNU/Linux as we know it today.

## AZOS GNU/Linux Features
 
 1. Low resource usage.
 2. Familiar and snappy workflow
 3. User-friendly and intuitive interface. (KDE Plasma Desktop)

## AZOS GNU/Linux Server

We have created a flavor of AZOS GNU/Linux, streamlined and optimized for datacenters and servers.

1. This flavor is faster and lighter than stock AZOS GNU/Linux
2. Server Maintenance Tool for easier maintenance of AZOS GNU/Linux's base, Arch Linux
3. All security features of stock AZOS GNU/Linux
4. We have replaced the stock Linux kernel with the Linux LTS kernel, to make the system more stable and reduce the need of kernel updates.

## **This Repo**

**Here resides the .iso file source code that we build.**

If you want to compile this code from source, you will have to run `steps.sh` by EZNIX inside the source code. Some times it will not work as azlocalrepository fails to sync, that means it is down for either maintenance or updating.
